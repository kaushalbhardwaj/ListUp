# ListUp

ListUp is a startup by IIT B alumnus which is a P2P social buying and selling marketplace for second-hand goods.ListUp is focused on P2P exchange of second hand goods, which aims to bridge buyers & sellers using location-based discovery of products and social approach to classifieds. Centred around geographical proximity, ListUp, enables people to discover interesting goods being sold in their neighbourhood, thereby minimising the time between contacting the seller via direct chat and meeting them in person. Unlike existing classifieds platforms, where there is no real seller identity, all ListUp users are socially verified, thereby adding to the trust factor in the transaction.
